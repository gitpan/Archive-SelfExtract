=head1 SYNOPSIS

    mkselfextract <perlsourcefile> <zipfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<mkselfextract> combines a file containing Perl code and a compressed

file into a temporary directory.

following:

    % zip -r9 distrib.zip src/ doc/ lib/ bin/
    % mkselfextract setup-script.pl distrib.zip > setup.pl
